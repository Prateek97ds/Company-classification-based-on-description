# Company-classification-based-on-description

Project Description: This project involved the classification of approximately 20,000 companies based on textual descriptions, encompassing both long and short descriptions, as provided in the "Company Descriptions" file. The goal was to assign each company to one of the predefined industry segments outlined in the "Industry Segments â€“ Top 10 Keywords" file.

The project's output included a comprehensive list of company names, each accompanied by the specific industry segment that had been assigned using a classification algorithm. This endeavor aimed to streamline industry categorization by leveraging natural language processing techniques, ultimately facilitating more efficient and accurate industry analysis and categorization.
